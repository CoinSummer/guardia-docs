# Privacy Policy

Effective date: October 20, 2024

Crypto Guardian is an Anti-Phishing Extension powered by CoinSummer labs.

This Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”) informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information (defined below) when you use the Services and the choices you have associated with that data.

## 1. Information We Collect  

a. No Personal Data Collection

Our Extension does not collect, store, or process any personal data. It operates entirely within your browser to manage website access based on a whitelist.

b. Local Data Storage

Whitelist configurations and other settings are stored locally on your device. These details are not transmitted to our servers or shared with third parties.

c. Logs and Analytics Data

The Extension does not log or analyze your browsing history or activity. All operations are performed locally and securely on your device.

## 2. How the Extension Works  

The Extension enforces website access restrictions based on a preconfigured whitelist. Specifically:

• Only websites explicitly included in the whitelist are accessible.

• Attempts to access non-whitelisted websites are blocked locally without transmitting data.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

Since the Extension does not collect personal or identifiable data, no information is used for any purpose. All operations are conducted locally on your device.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The Extension does not interact with third-party services or APIs, ensuring complete privacy and security in your browsing environment.

## 5. Data Security  

We are committed to maintaining the security of the Extension. It is developed using best practices to prevent vulnerabilities and unauthorized access. However, we cannot guarantee complete security and recommend that you keep your browser and software updated to minimize risks.

## 6. Your Rights  

Because no personal data is collected, you have full control over how the Extension is used. You may:

• Modify or reset the whitelist at any time.

• Uninstall the Extension to immediately disable its functionality.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy  

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or applicable laws. All updates will be posted here, and the “Effective Date” will be updated accordingly.
